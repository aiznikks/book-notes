# The Minimalist Entrepreneur

# Ask Yourself
“asked myself certain questions over and over again: What do I actually care to change? If I could fix one thing about my corner of the world, what would that be? What kind of business do I really want to build, own, and run?”

# Real Meaning of Minimalist
“There is something profoundly beautiful in a value-oriented mission and a genuine purpose driven by your own lived experience. This is what being a minimalist entrepreneur is all about: making a difference while making a living.”

> “one that prioritized profitability over growth and positive impact over moving fast and breaking things.”

# Start with Community
Minimalist entrepreneurs make sure they deeply understand the market first before creating anything.
1. **Observe Your Community**: Spend time understanding what problems or challenges people face in your community or target market.
2. **Build Relationships**: Engage in authentic conversations, connect with people, and build trust.
3. **Focus on Market Needs**: Before building anything, make sure you understand the real needs of the market. Don't assume—validate those needs by talking to people.
4. **Don’t Rush to Build**: Make sure there's a demand for the product before investing in creating it.
5. **Iterate**: After understanding the market and building something, stay connected with the community and be ready to adjust based on their feedback.

# Build as Little as Possible
1. **Start small**: Build only essential features for your product.
2. **Automate/delegate tasks**: Free up time by automating or outsourcing non-critical work.
3. **Focus on one solution**: Stick to one main goal and perfect it.
4. **Engage with customers**: Continuously work with your early users to improve the product.
5. **Ensure customer demand**: Before scaling, confirm that your solution is worth paying for.

# Sell to Your First 100 Customers
“Minimalist entrepreneurs don’t spend time convincing people—they spend time educating people. Selling is a discovery process, and minimalist entrepreneurs use sales as an opportunity to talk to potential customers one by one about their products while simultaneously educating themselves about the problem they are trying to solve for them. Selling this way is a long game built on relationships and vulnerability, not a one-day grand opening extravaganza followed by selling to strangers.”

# Market by Being You
“Speaking of vulnerability, minimalist entrepreneurs share their stories, from struggle to success.”

“Minimalist entrepreneurs understand that people care about other people, and educate, inspire, and entertain whenever and wherever they can. Instead of making headlines, they make fans—who turn themselves into customers over time.”

# Grow Yourself and Your Business Mindfully
“Minimalist entrepreneurs own their businesses, they don’t let their businesses own them. They don’t spend money they don’t have, and they don’t sacrifice profitability for scale. At this point, it becomes a game to lose . . . and minimalist entrepreneurs don’t lose.”

# Build the House You Want to Live In
“Minimalist entrepreneurs hire other minimalist entrepreneurs. Instead of following the status quo, they build their companies from first principles, alienating almost everyone. The way you do things won’t be for everyone, but it will be really great for a few people, and if you define your values early and often and tell the world who you are, they will find you. Conventional wisdom about how we work, when we work, and where we work is changing fast. Minimalist entrepreneurs understand there are few rules.”

> “If you’re profitable, you can take unlimited shots on goal, virtually guaranteeing your success as long as you keep learning from your customers. Most people don’t start. Most people who start don’t continue. Most people who continue give up. Many winners are just the last ones standing. Don’t give up.”

# Where Do You Start?
“Take a good hard look at the people, places, and communities you care about. Where are the pain points? What isn’t working, but might with a little elbow grease?”

# Creator First, Entrepreneur Second
On paper, it seems simple enough:
1. Narrow down who your ideal customer is. Narrow until you can narrow no more.
2. Define exactly what pain point you are solving for them, and how much they will pay you to solve it.
3. Set a hard deadline and focus fully on building a solution, then charge for it.
4. Repeat the process until you’ve found a product that works, then scale a business around it.

# Key Takeaways from Chapter 1
“KEY TAKEAWAYS: You don’t learn, then start. You start, then learn. Minimalist entrepreneurs focus on getting ‘profitable at all costs’ instead of growing at all costs. A business is a way to solve problems for people you care about—and get paid for it. Become a creator first, an entrepreneur second.”

# Chapter 2: Start with Community
“This process takes time, but done right and, most of all, done authentically, it will be the basis of how you move forward now and for years to come. Whether you’re just getting started or you’re already in the process of building a product, knowing and contributing to your community is key at every stage.”

“Communities are a place where we can connect, learn, and have fun.”

> “For minimalist entrepreneurs, communities are the starting point of any successful enterprise.”

“Build deep relationships first.”

## What is Community?
“The best communities are made up of individuals who might be otherwise dissimilar but who have shared interests, values, and abilities.”

“It’s a group of people who would likely never hang out with each other in any other situational context, and it often encompasses virtually every identity, including, yes, politics.”

- “You don’t have to bring your whole self to every community you join, but you do have to bring a slice of yourself.”

### Passion Economy
“Passion economy”—“a world in which people are able to do what they love for a living and to have a more fulfilling and purposeful life.”

Building a minimalist business around the people you love to spend time with and the ways you love to spend your time depends on being part of a community.

“Finding your people is really important at the beginning. Not just for the sake of your business but also for the sake of your own well-being.”

## Ask Yourself These Questions Daily to Find the Community:
- “If I talk, who listens?”
- “Where and with whom do I already spend my time, online and offline?”
- “In what situations am I most authentically myself?”
- “Who do I hang out with, even though I don’t really like them, but it’s worth it since we share something more important in common?”

## How to Start the Community:
- **Be a Part of It First**
    - “Being a member of a community is a start, but the real magic happens when you start to contribute.”

- **Contributing to the Community**
    - “Contributing means commenting, editing, and generally being part of the broader conversation. What’s more, if you go further and create by showing what you’re working on, teaching what you’re learning, and bringing new material to your community, that influence will grow ninetyfold.”

    - “While it’s better to lurk rather than needlessly comment, it’s even better to add value into the community even if you don’t feel that you’re ready. If you struggle with this, as many do, remind yourself that if you have something to add, it’s selfish to keep it to yourself!”
